## Getting Started

Welcome to the Java Simple Chatroom. Yes, It's a very simple system only with a command-line server and a GUI client. It's just to show how to build up a JAVA socket connection.
Run the server in terminal as follow:
> java SimpleChatServer
Run one or multi client in another terminal(s) on local machine:
> java SimpleChatClient
Type in client's input, then click 'Send'. All the client will receive the message.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
